* Querying triples (with RDB, document db, graph db, or dedicated triple store)
* Implementation: some Python

## Section 3 Search

* Database vs search engine
* Cost of inverted index
* Extend inverted index to model semantic relations

* D3 (and other JavaScript lib)
* NetworkX and  (and other Python lib)
* Implementation: some Python and Javascript

## Section 8 User Interaction

* It's about people, not machine

* Faceted Browser
* Voice interface and personal assistants
* Implementation: some Python

## Section 9: Big Data, or not

* Measuring semantics in data
* Small is beautiful in knowledge
* The rule of knowledge growth on Web
* Small knowledge

* Platforms: EC2 (boto), and some others
* Implementation: some Python

## Section 10  Lean Application Development

* Build, measure, learn
* Lean Canvas
* MVP
